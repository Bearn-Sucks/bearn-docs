# Introduction

## 🐻 What is Bearn? 🐻

Bearn is what happens when you combine the best of Yearn with the liquidity dynamics of Berachain!

Bearn takes Yearn's experience with liquid lockers and applies them to supercharge the Berachain flywheel with a liquid wrapper for BGT called yBGT, new Vaults, and a Bera-native, over-collateralized, demand driven stable coin called Bollar. Combined, these 3 elements open up new opportunities for positive sum yield farming on Berachain.
