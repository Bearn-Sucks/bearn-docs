# Bollar

## ðŸš§ COMING SOON ðŸš§

Bollar is a Bera native, over collateralized, demand driven stable coin made to work seamlessly with yBGT and Bearn Vaults.

At launch, Bollar will only be mintable using approved stable coins, such as USDC and USDS. All of the deposited stablecoins will then be deposited into the lowest risk Yearn Vaults on Ethereum mainnet to earn yield. Yield from these deposits will then periodically be harvested and bridged back to Berachain to incentivize positive sum ecosystem behaviors.

In the future BOLLAR will also be able to be minted using Bearn vaults as collateral giving even more use cases to the protocol.

Stay tuned-in to Bearn's socials for additional information on Bollar and it's upcoming launch
