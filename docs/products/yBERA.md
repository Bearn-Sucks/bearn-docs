# yBERA

yBERA is a 4626 Yearn multi-strategy vault that takes WBERA as the deposit asset and allocates the funds among yield bearing strategies throughout Berachain.

While under the hood yBERA operates as classic Yearn style vault. It is unique in the way that unlike a normal vault yBERA will always maintain a 1:1 ratio to BERA.
And the way the user receives their yield is dependant on how they use yBERA.

Users currently have two options in how to use yBERA

1. Simply stake your yBERA token in the styBERA vault and you will earn your deposits share of the yield earned by the vault as it comes in as if it were any other traditional vault product.

2. Use it in any of the Bearn LP pools that utilize it such as yBGT/yBERA. When deposited into an LP pool the yield generated is used to directly incentive or bribe for BGT emissions to that pool to boost the liquidity and yields payed to LP's.

By using the yield generated by yBERA to bribe and incentive the liquidity pools, users are supercharging the yield they would have otherwise earned and Bearn is able able to create a sustainable and continuous source of bribe incentives that scale with the pools its used in.

While the yield generated can create a continous stream of bribes and incentives to reward LP's, trading at 1:1 to BERA and being liquid means it can operate to end users just as WBERA would.
