# Vaults

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Vaults are how you earn yBGT :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Bearn Vaults are the easiest way to put your Berachain assets to work. Bearn offers rewards vaults for a wide range of Berachain DeFi products that are eligible for BGT rewards, including many BEX and Kodiak pools. The vaults come in 2 types, with the distinction being in how rewards are paid out.

- **yBGT Earner Vaults** receive rewards in yBGT tokens. When claimed, the earned BGT is claimed by the protocol and new yBGT is minted and given to the depositor.
- **Compounder Vaults** automatically redeem the earned BGT tokens to BERA tokens and sell them for more of the underlying vault token.

**The only way to get [yBGT](/docs/overview/yBGT.md) is to deposit in Bearn Vaults.** You don't need BGT or yBGT to deposit... So what are you waiting for?
