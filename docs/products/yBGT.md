## :zap:**yBGT supercharges native BGT.**:zap:

yBGT is a liquid wrapper and reward compounder for Berachain's BGT token. It works similarly to Yearn's [yCRV](https://docs.yearn.fi/getting-started/products/ylockers/ycrv/overview) in that when you deposit the base token, you get a new receipt token that gives you additional utility. You can use yBGT just like you use BGT, and also get a bunch of cool features.

### First, A Refresher on BGT

Berachain Governance Token (\$BGT) is a soulbound (aka non-transferrable) token that is used for voting in Berachain governance. It also can be used to "boost" validators and earn additional BGT and dApp fees. [Learn more about BGT](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) Finally, It can be burned for \$BERA, which is the native gas and staking token of Berachain. [Learn more about BERA](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/glossary#bera-token). Once burned, it cannot be converted back to \$BGT.

## ü§î Why BGT?

Here are 6 features that make yBGT best BGT derivative on the market.

- **Yield**: yBGT earns revenues from activity on Berachain, just like native BGT. Unlike many other BGT derivatives, yBGT is not beholden to any particular Berachain validators and can seek out the highest yields on the market. Yields go to staked yBGT so returns are further boosted when not all of the yBGT supply is staked.
- **Governance**: yBGT provides the same governance rights as native BGT. When the pass through governance system is up and running, it may even offer boosted governance power for stakers.
- **Liquidity**: Unlike native BGT, yBGT is not soulbound and can be sold on the open market like any other token.
- **Redeemability**: This one is underrated. Even though yBGT is liquid, this is crypto and pegs do peg things. yBGT always has a floor redeemability for BERA tokens.
- **Premium**: yBGT's premium over naked BGT should match any in the market given its feature completeness.
- **Automation**: yBGT is built with the expertise of Yearn's automation processes. You have control over how much you want to automate. You can earn yBGT and work the system, or sit back, relax, and let our vaults auto-compound the principal for you.

## üßë‚Äçüåæ Getting yBGT

You can't buy yBGT! yBGT can only be created when BGT is earned via Bearn Vaults and converted to yBGT. Any BGT claimed outside of the vaults cannot be converted to yBGT later. If you want it, you've gotta farm it!
