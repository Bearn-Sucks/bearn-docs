# Boints

We know what you're thinking... Please, not another points program! But the only thing worse than points is launching a token before the actual product. And in order to make sure early Bearn users are rewarded while allowing the important parts of the protocol to get the focus for now, were doing points.

Boints are going to be used to reward early users who are actively adding the most value to the protocol as it grows. Each Boint will map 1:1 to \$BEARN
once it is live, and they will be spread out across each of our products, with the initial focus being on yBGT.

300K points have been allocated to users who deposited and used the initial bearn.sucks beta website, with multipliers for those who tipped the devs.

Going forward, 75k Boints will be distributed per week, split between yBGT stakers (either direct or the auto compounder) and yBGT/yBERA LP depositors. Boints will be accumulated and updated at the end of each week.

*Amounts are subject to change, so please check the UI and X for updates.*
