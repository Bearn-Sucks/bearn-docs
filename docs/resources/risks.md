# Risks

Bearn has been built with safety and security in mind. However, there are inherent risks when interacting with any decentralized-finance smart contracts. Our team has vigorously reviewed it's smart contracts, and also pursued external auditors to identify potential vulnerabilities in the platform prior to launch.

Even so, the possibility of losing some or all of your funds is non-zero. Please exercise caution and work within your own risk framework when it comes to interacting with the platform.

Please see the Audits page for information on our external security audits.

As well as Bearn specific risks, users are also beholden to any risks that pertain to the underlying liquidity pools that Bearn integrates with. Please also review their documentation and risk explanations before interfacing with either platform.
