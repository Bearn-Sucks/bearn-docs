# Fees

Bearn earns fees in a variety of places. Some of these fees are sent to the treasury and some are used to help further incentive liquidity through BGT bribes and incentives.

Fees collected by the treasury will primarily be converted into yBGT and staked to earn the stable coin rewards and distributed to BEARN stakers.
